## (PwnKit) Self-Contained Version

The only limitation with the first exploit was the fact that a compiled version on the attacker's machine would not run in the victim's machine. This is mainly because of the different dependencies/GCC version differences in both machines. The self-contained version is/will therefore tbe compatible with different machines.
